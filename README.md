# Chocolate Sales Analysis Project
This project uses mock data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prajwal6362venom/choclate-sales-project) with it's main purpose being to practice and demonstrate my analytical skills in python.
## This project was both fun and challenging for me!

This was a fun adventure as I not only got to practice my skills but I was also able to learn some new and exciting things as well! 
Before this project, when it came to visualization libraries in python, I only had experience with Matplotlib and Seaborn but as I was building out my visuals, I craved something more. 
My curiosity led me to researching and reading articals online about the Plotly library and I decided to challenge myself by learning it and using it in this project to make some really neat Bar and Pie charts!

The most challenging part of using Plotly for me was that Github does not render my interactive Plotly charts and I didn't know this until after I included them in my project.
however, I wasn't going to allow this to stop me from finding a way to display them! I also had to figure out Github pages for hosting and export my charts as HTML files so that I could display
my Plotly charts and all their interactive glory!
